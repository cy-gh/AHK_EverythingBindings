# What is this?

Autohotkey/AHK bindings for [Everything Search (ES) from Void Tools](https://www.voidtools.com/), which directly call the .dll functions. Most functions are implemented and functional but I lost interest, because my favorite File Manager, Directory Opus, also integreated Everything into DOpus.

You need Everything64.dll from the [Everything SDK](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/sdk/). It may also work for 32-bit version, but not tested.
